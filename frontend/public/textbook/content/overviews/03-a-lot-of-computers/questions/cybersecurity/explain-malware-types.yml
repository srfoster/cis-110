question: "What are the main types of malware that you should look out for?"
answer: "Malware includes several major categories such as ransomware, spyware, keyloggers, Trojans, worms, viruses, bots, and rootkits. Each type uses different methods to damage systems, steal information, or gain unauthorized access."

answer_kindergarten: "🧸 Malware is like sneaky bad software that tries to break your computer or steal things. Some lock your files, some watch what you type, and some pretend to be nice apps but aren’t."

answer_3rd_grade: "🎒 Malware comes in different types. Some lock your computer for money (ransomware), some watch what you do (spyware), some pretend to be safe (Trojans), and some spread fast across computers (worms and viruses)."

answer_7th_grade: "📚 Common malware types include ransomware (locks data for payment), spyware/keyloggers (steal information), Trojans/RATs (pretend to be safe to gain access), worms and viruses (spread across systems), bots (turn computers into zombies), and rootkits (help malware hide)."

answer_high_school: "🎓 Major malware categories include: ransomware (encrypts data for ransom), spyware and keyloggers (capture activity), Trojans and remote-access Trojans (disguise malicious intent), viruses and worms (self-replicating), bots/botnets (remote-controlled systems), rootkits (hiding mechanisms), bloatware (unwanted installed software), and logic bombs (triggered malicious code). These vary in how they spread, hide, and damage systems."

answer_undergraduate: "📘 Malware can be grouped by the primary action it performs:  
- **Kidnap**: Ransomware that locks systems or encrypts data until payment.  
- **Eavesdrop**: Spyware and keyloggers that collect information silently.  
- **Masquerade**: Trojans and RATs that hide malicious intent behind legitimate-looking software.  
- **Launch**: Viruses, worms, bots, and bloatware used to spread, replicate, or perform coordinated attacks.  
- **Sidestep**: Rootkits, logic bombs, and backdoors used to evade detection and provide long-term unauthorized access.  
 This classification reflects modern cybersecurity models taught in industry and academic courses."
