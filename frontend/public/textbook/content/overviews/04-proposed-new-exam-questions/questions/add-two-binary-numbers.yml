question: "Randomly generate two 2-digit decimal numbers, convert them to binary, add them together, then convert the answer back into decimal."
answer: "Example: Add 85 and 55, in binary they are 1010101 and 110111. Adding in binary is the same as it is in decimal, when you can't add two digits, you carry the one. We see that the bits in the one's place add to make 2, but we can't have that in binary, so we set that digit to zero and carry the one to the next place. Next, we are adding zero plus one plus the one carried over previously, so we set to zero and carry over again. In the four's place, we add one plus one plus the extra one carried over previously; this makes 3, in this case we set to one instead of zero and carry over. Continuing this process for each digit yeilds 10001100. This converts to 140 in decimal which confirms the result of adding 85 and 55."
