## Exam Question: What is Metadata?

**Question:**  
What is metadata? Give one example of metadata and explain what it describes.

**Answer Key:**  
Metadata is "data about data" — it gives information that describes or explains other data.

**Example:**  
A photo’s metadata might include the date it was taken, the camera type, or the location.  
This metadata describes details about the photo itself, not the photo’s content.
