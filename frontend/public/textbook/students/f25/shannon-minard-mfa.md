## Exam Question: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

**Question:**  
Explain what Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is and why it improves security compared to using only a password.

**Answer (for answer key):**  
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) requires a user to verify their identity using at least two different types of authentication factors, such as a password, a smartphone code, or a fingerprint. This improves security because even if one factor (like a password) is stolen, an attacker would still need the additional factor(s) to gain access.
