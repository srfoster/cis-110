question: "Discuss the pros and cons of using a password manager"
answer: "Password managers allow users to generate and store passwords for all of their accounts. This feature enables users to prevent password reuse and enhances their overall security, as the quality of the password surpasses that of a typical user-generated password. Typically the main flaw of strong passwords is the reduction in likelihood for the user to remember them. Password managers take care of all of this, requiring users to simply remember one master password. Password managers are not without their flaws; by using a master password system, a single point of failure is created, as all it would take for a bad faith actor to gain access to all of your passwords is to somehow get ahold of your master password. Another issue can arise with potential system breaches or issues with the password management system itself. As any failures could lead to the users' information being leaked. "
