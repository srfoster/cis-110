answer_undergraduate: "🧠 Markdown is a lightweight, plaintext-oriented declarative markup formalism designed to provide a human-readable abstraction layer over structurally significant formatting conventions. Conceptually, it operates as a semantic annotation mechanism in which typographical cues—such as hash symbols, asterisks, and backticks—are overloaded to encode hierarchical document structure, typographic emphasis, and code demarcation without requiring the verbosity or syntactic rigor characteristic of full-scale markup languages like HTML or XML ."
