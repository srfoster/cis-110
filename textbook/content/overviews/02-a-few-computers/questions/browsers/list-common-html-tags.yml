question: "List 5 common HTML tags and explain what they do"
answer: "Here are 5 common HTML tags: 1) <h1> - Creates the largest heading, used for main titles. 2) <p> - Defines a paragraph of text with automatic spacing above and below. 3) <a> - Creates hyperlinks to other web pages or sections, using the href attribute for the destination. 4) <img> - Displays images on the webpage, using src attribute for the image file location. 5) <ul> and <li> - Create unordered (bulleted) lists, where <ul> contains the list and <li> defines each list item. These tags form the building blocks of most web pages by structuring content into headings, text, links, images, and lists."

answer_kindergarten: "🧸 HTML tags are like labels that tell the computer what each part of a webpage should be! Here are 5 important ones: 1) <h1> makes BIG titles like the name of your favorite story, 2) <p> makes regular text like the words in your story, 3) <a> makes magic words you can click to go to other pages, 4) <img> puts pictures on your webpage, and 5) <ul> and <li> make lists with bullet points like your grocery list!"

answer_3rd_grade: "📚 HTML tags are like instructions that tell the computer how to organize a webpage! Here are 5 common ones: 1) <h1> creates big headings for titles, 2) <p> makes paragraphs of regular text, 3) <a> creates clickable links that take you to other websites, 4) <img> shows pictures on the page, and 5) <ul> and <li> make bulleted lists.

answer_7th_grade: "🤔 Here are 5 essential HTML tags: 1) ** <h1> ** creates main headings (there are also h2, h3, etc. for smaller headings), 2) ** <p> ** defines paragraphs of text with automatic spacing, 3) **<a href='url'>** creates clickable links to other pages or websites, 4) **<img src='filename'>** displays images (note: it's self-closing), 5) **<ul>** and **<li>** create bulleted lists where ul contains the whole list and li defines each item. These tags structure most webpage content."

answer_high_school: "🎓 Five fundamental HTML elements: 1) <h1>-<h6> create semantic heading hierarchy for document structure and SEO, 2) <p> defines paragraph blocks with default margin spacing, 3) <a href='destination'> creates hyperlinks with attributes like target='_blank' for new windows, 4) <img src='path' alt='description'> embeds images with required alt text for accessibility, 5) <ul>/<li> structure unordered lists (vs <ol> for ordered). Modern HTML emphasizes semantic meaning over presentation, with CSS handling visual styling."

answer_undergraduate: "🧠 Core HTML5 semantic elements: 1) <h1-h6> establish document outline hierarchy for accessibility screen readers and SEO ranking algorithms, 2) <p> creates block-level paragraph containers with collapsing margin behavior, 3) <a> implements hypermedia links with rel attributes (nofollow, noopener), prefetch hints, and download functionality, 4) <img> supports responsive images via srcset/sizes attributes, lazy loading, and WebP/AVIF formats, 5) <ul>/<li> provide accessible list semantics with ARIA roles, CSS list-style customization, and flexbox/grid layout integration for modern responsive design patterns."
