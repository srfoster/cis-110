question: "Explain what a Web cookie is"
answer: "A web cookie is a small text file that websites store on your computer through your browser to remember information about your visit. Cookies contain data like login status, shopping cart contents, language preferences, or tracking information. When you revisit a website, your browser sends the cookie back to the site, allowing it to 'remember' you and provide a personalized experience. There are different types: session cookies (deleted when you close the browser) and persistent cookies (stay until they expire or you delete them). While cookies enable useful features like staying logged in, they also raise privacy concerns because they can track browsing behavior across websites."

answer_kindergarten: "🧸 A web cookie is like a little note that websites leave in your computer's pocket! When you visit a website, it might leave a note saying 'this person likes the color blue' or 'this person put a toy in their shopping cart.' Next time you visit, the website reads its note and remembers what you liked! It's like how your teacher might remember that you like dinosaurs and shows you dinosaur books."

answer_3rd_grade: "📚 Web cookies are tiny files that websites save on your computer to remember things about you. Think of it like a name tag that a store gives you - when you come back, they see your name tag and remember you! Cookies help websites remember if you're logged in, what's in your shopping cart, or what language you speak. Some cookies are helpful, but others might follow you around the internet to see what websites you visit."

answer_7th_grade: "🤔 Web cookies are small data files that websites store in your browser to remember information between visits. When you log into a site, it might store a cookie to keep you logged in. Shopping sites use cookies to remember what's in your cart. Some cookies track which pages you visit for advertising purposes. There are session cookies (disappear when you close the browser) and persistent cookies (stay longer). You can manage cookies in your browser settings to control privacy."

answer_high_school: "🎓 Cookies are HTTP state management mechanisms that enable stateful sessions over the stateless HTTP protocol. They include attributes like domain scope, path restrictions, expiration dates, and security flags (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite). First-party cookies come from the site you're visiting, while third-party cookies are set by external domains (often for advertising). Modern browsers implement cookie policies, cross-site tracking prevention, and user controls. Cookies enable authentication persistence, user preferences, and analytics, but also facilitate behavioral tracking and fingerprinting."

answer_undergraduate: "🧠 Cookies implement RFC 6265 with name-value pairs and metadata attributes controlling scope, lifetime, and security properties. SameSite attributes (Strict, Lax, None) mitigate CSRF attacks, while Secure and HttpOnly flags prevent XSS exploitation. Third-party cookie deprecation drives adoption of Privacy Sandbox APIs (Topics, FLEDGE, Attribution Reporting) and server-side tracking alternatives. Cookie synchronization enables cross-domain identity linking, while techniques like cookie syncing, probabilistic matching, and device fingerprinting maintain tracking capabilities. Regulatory frameworks (GDPR, CCPA) mandate consent mechanisms and user control over cookie-based data collection."
