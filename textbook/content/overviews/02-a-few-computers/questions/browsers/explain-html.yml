question: "Explain what HTML is"
answer: "HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create the structure and content of web pages. HTML uses tags (keywords surrounded by angle brackets) to define different elements like headings, paragraphs, links, images, and lists. It's called 'markup' because you mark up text with tags to indicate how it should be displayed or structured. HTML provides the skeleton of a webpage - the basic content and organization - while CSS handles the visual styling and JavaScript adds interactivity. Every web page you visit is built with HTML, which browsers interpret to display the content in a formatted way."

answer_kindergarten: "🧸 HTML is like the instructions you give to your computer to build a webpage! Just like you might tell someone 'put the title at the top, then add a picture, then write some words,' HTML uses special codes called tags that tell the computer where to put titles, pictures, and words. It's like building with blocks - each block (tag) has a special job to make your webpage!"

answer_3rd_grade: "📚 HTML is the language we use to make websites! It's like writing a story, but instead of just writing words, you use special codes called tags to tell the computer what each part should be. You put words between <title> tags to make a title, between <p> tags to make a paragraph, and use <img> tags to add pictures. It's like giving the computer a recipe for how to build your webpage!"

answer_7th_grade: "🤔 HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the building blocks of every website. You write content (text, links, images) and wrap it in tags like <h1> for headings, <p> for paragraphs, and <a> for links. These tags tell the browser how to structure and display the content. HTML is just the skeleton - it doesn't make things look pretty (that's CSS's job) or make them interactive (that's JavaScript's job), but it provides the essential structure that every webpage needs."

answer_high_school: "🎓 HTML is a markup language that uses a hierarchical tree structure of elements to define web document semantics. Tags like <header>, <nav>, <main>, and <footer> provide semantic meaning beyond just structure. HTML5 introduced new semantic elements, form controls, multimedia elements (<video>, <audio>), and APIs for offline storage and geolocation. The Document Object Model (DOM) represents HTML as a tree structure that browsers parse and JavaScript can manipulate. HTML follows strict syntax rules and supports attributes that provide metadata and behavior for elements."

answer_undergraduate: "🧠 HTML implements a context-free grammar defining well-formed document structures using SGML-derived syntax. The HTML parser constructs a DOM tree through tokenization, tree construction, and error recovery mechanisms that handle malformed markup. HTML5 introduced living standard specifications with semantic microdata, ARIA accessibility attributes, custom elements via Web Components, and integration with CSS selectors and JavaScript APIs. Modern HTML supports progressive enhancement patterns, responsive images with srcset/picture elements, and web standards like Service Workers, Web Workers, and emerging technologies like WebAssembly integration."
