question: "Explain what happens 'behind the scenes' when you access a URL in your browser"
answer: "When you type a URL like 'www.example.com' and press Enter, several steps happen automatically: \n**1. DNS Lookup** - Your browser contacts a DNS (Domain Name System) server to translate the human-readable domain name into an IP address (like 192.168.1.1). \n**2. Connection** - Your browser establishes a connection to the web server at that IP address using HTTP or HTTPS protocol. \n**3. Request** - Your browser sends an HTTP request asking for the specific webpage or resource. \n**4. Server Processing** - The web server receives the request, processes it, and prepares the response (HTML, CSS, images, etc.). \n**5. Response** - The server sends the webpage data back to your browser. \n**6. Rendering** - Your browser receives the data and renders it into the visual webpage you see. This entire process typically happens in seconds, involving multiple computers and network infrastructure working together seamlessly."

answer_kindergarten: "🧸 When you type a website name and press Enter, it's like asking for directions to a friend's house! First, your computer asks a special helper (like a phone book) 'Where does this website live?' The helper gives your computer the website's address. Then your computer goes to that address and knocks on the door saying 'Can I see your website please?' The website's computer then sends all the pictures and words back to your computer so you can see the website on your screen!"

answer_3rd_grade: "📚 When you visit a website, here's what happens: 1) You type the website name, 2) Your computer asks a DNS server 'What's the real address for this website?' (like looking up a phone number), 3) Your computer connects to that address, 4) Your computer asks 'Can I have this webpage please?', 5) The website's computer sends all the webpage parts (text, pictures, videos), 6) Your browser puts all the pieces together like a puzzle to show you the complete website!"

answer_7th_grade: "🤔 Here's what happens when you visit a URL: 1) **DNS Resolution** - Your browser contacts DNS servers to convert the domain name to an IP address, 2) **TCP Connection** - Your browser connects to the web server using that IP address, 3) **HTTP Request** - Your browser sends a request for the specific page, 4) **Server Processing** - The web server finds and prepares the requested content, 5) **HTTP Response** - The server sends back HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images, 6) **Browser Rendering** - Your browser interprets the code and displays the visual webpage."

answer_high_school: "🎓 The URL request lifecycle involves: 1) **DNS Resolution** - Recursive queries through DNS hierarchy (root servers, TLD servers, authoritative servers) with caching at multiple levels, 2) **TCP Handshake** - Three-way handshake establishes reliable connection, 3) **TLS Negotiation** - For HTTPS, certificate verification and encryption key exchange, 4) **HTTP Request** - Browser sends headers (User-Agent, Accept, etc.) and request method (GET, POST), 5) **Server Processing** - Web server processes request, potentially involving databases or application logic, 6) **HTTP Response** - Server returns status code, headers, and content, 7) **Rendering Pipeline** - Browser parses HTML, builds DOM, applies CSS, executes JavaScript."

answer_undergraduate: "🧠 URL resolution implements complex distributed systems: 1) **DNS Resolution** uses hierarchical caching (browser cache, OS cache, recursive resolver, authoritative servers) with TTL-based invalidation and anycast for performance, 2) **Connection Establishment** involves TCP congestion control, HTTP/2 multiplexing or HTTP/3 QUIC protocols, 3) **TLS Handshake** includes certificate chain validation, OCSP stapling, and forward secrecy key exchange, 4) **Request Processing** may trigger CDN edge caching, load balancing algorithms, and microservice architectures, 5) **Response Delivery** uses HTTP caching headers, content encoding (gzip/brotli), and streaming for large payloads, 6) **Browser Rendering** implements critical rendering path optimization, progressive enhancement, and service worker interception."
