question: "List some of the basic steps in the programming process from writing code to running it"
answer: "The programming process involves several key steps: \n**1. Writing Source Code** - Programmer writes instructions in a high-level language using a text editor or IDE. \n**2. Compilation/Translation** - A compiler or interpreter processes the source code, checking for syntax errors and translating it to machine code or preparing it for execution. \n**3. Loading** - The operating system loads the program from storage into memory. \n**4. Execution** - The CPU fetches, decodes, and executes the machine code instructions one by one. \n**5. Runtime** - The program runs, potentially interacting with users, reading files, or communicating over networks. Each step transforms the human-readable code into something the computer can execute."

answer_kindergarten: "🧸 Making a computer program is like building with LEGO! First, you draw a picture of what you want to build (writing code). Then you follow the instructions to put the blocks together (compiling). Finally, you can play with your creation (running the program)! The computer needs to understand your instructions step by step, just like following a LEGO instruction book."

answer_3rd_grade: "📚 Programming is like writing a recipe for the computer to follow! First, you write the recipe in a special computer language. Then a helper program checks if your recipe makes sense and translates it into computer language. The computer then follows your recipe step by step to do what you wanted - like showing a game on the screen or solving a math problem!"

answer_7th_grade: "🤔 Programming follows these main steps: 1) Write your code in a programming language like Python or Java using a text editor, 2) A compiler or interpreter checks your code for mistakes and converts it into instructions the computer understands, 3) The operating system loads your program into the computer's memory, 4) The processor executes your program's instructions one by one, 5) Your program runs and does whatever you programmed it to do - like displaying graphics or calculating results."

answer_high_school: "🎓 The programming workflow includes: 1) **Source code creation** using IDEs with syntax highlighting and debugging tools, 2) **Static analysis** where compilers perform lexical analysis, parsing, and semantic checking while optimizing code, 3) **Linking** to combine object files and libraries into executables, 4) **Loading** where the OS creates process memory space and loads the executable, 5) **Runtime execution** where the CPU executes instructions while the program manages memory, handles I/O, and responds to events. Modern development includes additional steps like testing, version control, and deployment."

answer_undergraduate: "🧠 The programming process involves multiple compilation phases: lexical analysis (tokenization), syntactic analysis (parsing to AST), semantic analysis (type checking, scope resolution), intermediate code generation, optimization passes (constant folding, dead code elimination, register allocation), and machine code generation. The runtime system includes program loading (ELF/PE parsing, relocation, symbol resolution), virtual memory management, dynamic linking, garbage collection (for managed languages), exception handling, and system call interfaces. Modern toolchains integrate static analysis, profiling, debugging symbols, and runtime instrumentation for performance optimization and security analysis."
