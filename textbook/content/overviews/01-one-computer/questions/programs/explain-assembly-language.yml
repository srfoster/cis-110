question: "Explain what assembly language is and how it relates to machine code"
answer: "Assembly language is a low-level programming language that uses human-readable mnemonics (like ADD, LOAD, STORE) to represent machine code instructions. Each assembly instruction corresponds directly to one machine code instruction, making it a one-to-one translation. For example, 'ADD R1, R2' in assembly might translate to the binary machine code '01001001 00000001 00000010'. Assembly language makes machine code programming more manageable for humans while still giving direct control over the CPU. An assembler (a simple type of compiler) translates assembly language into machine code. Assembly is used for system programming, device drivers, and situations requiring precise hardware control, though most modern programming is done in higher-level languages."

answer_kindergarten: "🧸 Imagine if computers only understood numbers like 0110100110, but that's really hard for people to remember! Assembly language is like giving nicknames to those long numbers - instead of remembering 0110100110, you can just say 'ADD' which means 'add these numbers together.' It's like having a secret code that both you and the computer can understand!"

answer_3rd_grade: "📚 Computers only understand 1s and 0s (called machine code), but that's super hard for people to read and write. Assembly language gives easy-to-remember names to those 1s and 0s. Instead of writing '01001001 00000001', you can write 'ADD R1, R2' which means 'add the numbers in box R1 and box R2.' It's like having a translation dictionary between human words and computer numbers!"

answer_7th_grade: "🤔 Assembly language uses simple English-like commands (called mnemonics) to represent the 1s and 0s that processors actually execute. Each assembly instruction matches exactly one machine code instruction. For example, 'MOV AX, 5' means 'put the number 5 into register AX' and translates to a specific pattern of binary digits. An assembler program converts assembly code into machine code. Assembly is still used today for writing operating systems, device drivers, and programs that need to control hardware directly."

answer_high_school: "🎓 Assembly language provides a symbolic representation of machine code using mnemonics, registers, and memory addressing modes. Each assembly instruction maps directly to one machine instruction with no abstraction layer - this one-to-one correspondence gives programmers precise control over CPU operations. Different processor architectures (x86, ARM, RISC-V) have different assembly languages reflecting their instruction sets. Assembly programming involves managing registers, memory addresses, and control flow explicitly. Modern compilers can generate optimized assembly code, but hand-written assembly is still used for performance-critical code sections and system-level programming."

answer_undergraduate: "🧠 Assembly language serves as the symbolic representation of a processor's instruction set architecture (ISA), providing human-readable mnemonics for opcodes, operands, and addressing modes. The assembler performs lexical analysis and symbol resolution, handling labels, directives, and macro expansions while maintaining the direct mapping to machine code. Different assembly syntaxes (Intel vs AT&T for x86) reflect various conventions for operand ordering and addressing notation. Modern assembly programming involves understanding processor pipelines, cache behavior, and SIMD instructions for optimization. Assembly remains critical for bootloaders, kernel development, compiler backends, and reverse engineering where precise hardware control and minimal overhead are essential."
