question: "Design an efficient file organization system for a specific use case (academic, professional, creative)"
answer: "For academic use case: Implement a hierarchical structure like /Course/Week#/Topic/ with consistent ISO date prefixes (YYYY-MM-DD), separate directories for /Resources, /Drafts, /Final, and /Archive. Use semantic version suffixes (v1, v2) for iterative work, maintain a /Templates directory for reusable formats, and establish periodic archival procedures. Include metadata-rich filenames incorporating course codes, assignment types, and version indicators. This system supports collaboration through shared conventions, enables efficient retrieval through predictable organization, and scales across multiple semesters while maintaining academic workflow requirements. Other use cases may differ slightly, but the same general principles still apply. All file organization systems should be predictable, standardized, and easily scalable."

answer_kindergarten: "Let's organize your school files like organizing your toy room! First, make BIG FOLDERS for each subject - one for Math, one for Reading, one for Art. Inside each subject folder, make smaller folders for each week or month. Give your files good names that tell you what they are - like 'Math-Counting-Week1' instead of just 'homework.' Keep a special FINISHED folder for work you're done with, and a WORKING folder for things you're still doing. This way, when your teacher asks for your Week 2 math work, you know exactly where to find it - just like knowing your crayons are in the art box and your blocks are in the block box!"

answer_3rd_grade: "A good school file system is like organizing your desk and backpack! Start with MAIN FOLDERS for each class (Math, Science, English, History), then create WEEKLY SUBFOLDERS inside each class folder. Use a naming system like '2024-03-15-Math-Fractions-Homework' so your files are automatically sorted by date. Create special folders like 'RESOURCES' for handouts and reference materials, 'DRAFTS' for work in progress, and 'FINISHED' for completed assignments. Keep a TEMPLATE folder with blank formats you use often (like essay outlines or lab report forms). At the end of each semester, move old work to an ARCHIVE folder so your current folders don't get cluttered. This system helps you find any assignment quickly and keeps your work organized for the whole school year!"

answer_7th_grade: "Effective academic file organization requires SYSTEMATIC ARCHITECTURE balancing accessibility with scalability. Implement a three-tier hierarchy: /Semester/Course/Category/ where categories include Lectures, Assignments, Projects, Resources, and Archive. Utilize STANDARDIZED NAMING CONVENTIONS with ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD), course prefixes (CHEM101, HIST204), and descriptive content indicators (Lab-Report, Essay-Draft). Establish WORKFLOW-SPECIFIC DIRECTORIES including /Active (current work), /Review (pending feedback), /Complete (finished assignments), and /Templates (reusable formats). Implement VERSION CONTROL through numeric suffixes (v1, v2) and maintain METADATA CONSISTENCY through structured filename components. Create automated ARCHIVAL PROCEDURES moving completed work to semester-specific archives, enabling efficient space management while preserving academic records. This system supports collaborative sharing through predictable organization and enables rapid content retrieval during study sessions and assignment preparation."
