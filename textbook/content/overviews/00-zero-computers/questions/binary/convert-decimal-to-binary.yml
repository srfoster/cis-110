question: "Randomly generate a 2-digit decimal number, and convert it to binary"
answer: "Example: To convert 13 to binary, we repeatedly divide by 2 and track the remainders: 13 ÷ 2 = 6 remainder 1, 6 ÷ 2 = 3 remainder 0, 3 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 1, 1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1. Reading the remainders from bottom to top gives us 1101. We can verify: 1×8 + 1×4 + 0×2 + 1×1 = 8 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 13. Therefore, 13 in decimal equals 1101 in binary."

answer_kindergarten: "Let's turn the number 13 into computer language (binary)! It's like breaking a number into groups of 2. First, I'll ask: can 13 be split into 2 equal groups? 13 ÷ 2 = 6 with 1 leftover. Write down that 1! Now can 6 be split? 6 ÷ 2 = 3 with 0 leftover. Write down that 0! Can 3 be split? 3 ÷ 2 = 1 with 1 leftover. Write that 1! Finally, 1 ÷ 2 = 0 with 1 leftover. Write that 1! Now read the leftovers backwards: 1101. That's 13 in computer language!"

answer_3rd_grade: "Converting 13 to binary is like finding out how many groups of powers of 2 fit into 13. We use division by 2 repeatedly. Step 1: 13 ÷ 2 = 6 remainder 1 (write down 1). Step 2: 6 ÷ 2 = 3 remainder 0 (write down 0). Step 3: 3 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 1 (write down 1). Step 4: 1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1 (write down 1). Reading our remainders from bottom to top: 1101. Check: In binary, this means 1×8 + 1×4 + 0×2 + 1×1 = 8+4+0+1 = 13 ✓"

answer_7th_grade: "Converting decimal 13 to binary uses the division-by-2 algorithm. This method exploits the fact that binary place values are powers of 2 (1, 2, 4, 8, 16...). Algorithm: Divide by 2, record remainder, repeat with quotient until quotient = 0. For 13: 13÷2=6 r1, 6÷2=3 r0, 3÷2=1 r1, 1÷2=0 r1. Binary result: 1101₂. Verification using positional notation: 1×2³ + 1×2² + 0×2¹ + 1×2⁰ = 8+4+0+1 = 13₁₀. This algorithm works because each division extracts the least significant bit."

answer_high_school: "Decimal-to-binary conversion implements the division-remainder algorithm, which systematically decomposes a decimal integer into its binary representation. For n=13: apply floor division and modulo operations iteratively. 13 mod 2 = 1 (LSB), 13÷2=6; 6 mod 2 = 0, 6÷2=3; 3 mod 2 = 1, 3÷2=1; 1 mod 2 = 1 (MSB), 1÷2=0. Result: 1101₂. This algorithm extracts coefficients for the polynomial expansion 13 = ∑(aᵢ × 2ⁱ) where aᵢ ∈ {0,1}. Alternative methods include successive subtraction of largest powers of 2, or direct polynomial coefficient determination."

answer_undergraduate: "Decimal-to-binary conversion represents a fundamental radix transformation implementing Horner's method in reverse. The algorithm performs repeated Euclidean division by the target base (2), extracting digits through modular arithmetic. For n=13: applying the iterative relation aᵢ = n mod 2, n ← ⌊n/2⌋ yields the binary representation through coefficient extraction in the polynomial form ∑(aᵢ × 2ⁱ). This process has O(log₂ n) complexity and can be optimized using bitwise operations (n & 1 for LSB, n >> 1 for right shift). Hardware implementations utilize shift registers and parallel processing for simultaneous multi-bit conversion in logarithmic time complexity."
