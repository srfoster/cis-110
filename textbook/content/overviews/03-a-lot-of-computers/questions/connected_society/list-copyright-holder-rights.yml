answer_undergraduate: "🏛️ The six exclusive rights under 17 U.S.C. §106 constitute the bundle of rights that define copyright ownership and enable economic exploitation of creative works: 1) **Reproduction Rights** - Control over mechanical reproduction, digital copying, and format conversion, creating the foundation for licensing revenue, 2) **Derivative Works Rights** - Control over transformative uses, enabling expansion into different media markets and licensing for adaptations, 3) **Distribution Rights** - Control over public distribution channels, subject to first sale doctrine limitations but enabling control over unauthorized distribution networks, 4) **Public Performance Rights** - Control over performance in public spaces, fundamental to performance royalties through organizations like ASCAP and BMI, 5) **Public Display Rights** - Control over visual presentation, crucial for visual arts markets and digital display licensing, 6) **Digital Audio Transmission Rights** - Control over non-interactive digital transmissions, specifically addressing streaming and satellite radio revenue streams.
