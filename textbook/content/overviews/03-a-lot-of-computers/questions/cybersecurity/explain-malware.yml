question: "Explain what malware is"
answer: "Malware (malicious software) is any software intentionally designed to cause damage, steal information, or gain unauthorized access to computer systems. Common types include viruses (that spread by attaching to other files), worms (that spread automatically across networks), trojans (that disguise themselves as legitimate software), ransomware (that encrypts files and demands payment), and spyware (that secretly monitors user activity). Malware can slow down computers, steal personal information like passwords and credit card numbers, delete important files, or give criminals remote control of infected devices."

answer_kindergarten: "🦠 Malware is like computer germs that make computers sick! Just like how real germs can make you feel yucky, computer germs (malware) can make computers run slowly, delete important pictures, or let bad people see your private stuff. That's why we need computer medicine (antivirus) to keep the computer germs away and make sure our computers stay healthy and safe!"

answer_3rd_grade: "💻 Malware is bad software that sneaky people create to mess up computers. It's like when someone puts a mean program on your computer that does things you don't want - like stealing your passwords, deleting your games, or making your computer super slow. There are different types: viruses spread like real viruses, trojans pretend to be good programs but are actually bad, and ransomware locks up your files until you pay money. That's why you should only download things from safe places!"

answer_7th_grade: "⚠️ Malware (malicious software) is created by cybercriminals to harm computers or steal information. Major types include: viruses that attach to files and spread when shared, worms that automatically spread across networks, trojans that trick users by appearing legitimate, ransomware that encrypts data for ransom, rootkits that hide deep in systems, and spyware that secretly steals information. Malware spreads through infected email attachments, malicious websites, infected USB drives, and software downloads from untrusted sources."

answer_high_school: "🛡️ Malware encompasses various malicious software categories with different attack vectors and payloads. Viruses require host programs for replication, while worms self-propagate through network vulnerabilities. Trojans use social engineering, appearing as legitimate software. Advanced threats include polymorphic viruses that change code to evade detection, fileless malware that operates in memory, and multi-stage attacks. Modern malware often includes anti-analysis techniques, command-and-control communications, and cryptocurrency mining capabilities. Protection requires layered security including updated antivirus, firewalls, and user education."

answer_undergraduate: "🔬 Malware represents a diverse ecosystem of malicious code employing sophisticated evasion techniques. Static analysis resistance includes packers, obfuscation, and anti-debugging mechanisms. Dynamic analysis evasion uses VM detection, sandbox awareness, and delayed execution. Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) utilize zero-day exploits, living-off-the-land techniques, and stealthy lateral movement. Machine learning-based detection systems analyze behavioral patterns, while adversarial machine learning allows malware to evade AI-based defenses. Modern threats include supply chain attacks, cryptojacking, and IoT botnets requiring comprehensive threat intelligence and automated response capabilities."
